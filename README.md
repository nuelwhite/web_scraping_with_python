## Web Scraping with Python

### Overview

In this tutorial or practice, we will look at the fundamentals of web scraping, how to use Python to request information from a web server, how to extract useful information from the server's response, and how to automize interaction with a website.

Web scraping sounds like a complex concept that requires some high level technical competency to be able to write a simple scraping code. But so far, all I have been hearing is, it actually sounds exactly like that but it is very easy to do. You can scrape a website in like 3 lines of python code.

The book I used for this practice, ```web scraping with python - collecting more data from the modern web, 2nd Edition```, is splitted into 2 parts, with PART I covering fundamentals, mechanics of web scraping and PART II being Advanced with more complex projects. Part I consists of chapters 1 to chapter 6.

### What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the automated process of extracting data and content from websites, parsing these contents and extracting the useful information from it, and storing the data in a structured format. Instead of manually copying and pasting contents from a webpage, custom scripts or bots gather the information quickly and efficiently, turning unstructured web content into usable and structured data.

### Why Web Scraping?

Web browsers help render webpages for humans to be able to read and use. But for large amounts of data, manually going through the browser to gather the data will be time consuming and inefficient. Web scrapers come in handy here, they are efficient in gathering large amounts of data, rather than viewing webpages one at a time, a scraper will produce all content at once.

Web scrapers can go places traditional search engines cannot. Web scrapers can help in the following:
- *Market Research*: Gathering data from forums, social media, and e-commerce sites for sentiment analysis and competitor pricing.
- *Data Analysis*: Collecting vast amounts of data for research purposes.
- *Business Intelligence*: Monitoring prices, brand mentions, and market trends to gain insights and make informed decisions.
- *AI and Machine Learning*: Providing data for for training AI algorithms, helping them to become smarter and more effective.

### KEY CONSIDERATIONS

I've been wondering, and probably anybody who wants to do this wonders same, is web scraping legal? Yes it is. But there are few things to consider when scraping the site of an organization. 

- It is essential to respect the websites Terms of Service, and avoid overwhelming its servers with too many requests.
- Excessive scraping can lead to IP Address banning. Websites may have some restrictions like authentication requirements.


Although manually going through web pages and copying and pasting the data is technically web scraping, the automated process is what we refer to as web scraping.
